Pillar, plate, pot, Rack, Round table, Shelf, Spoon, Stairs, Stools, Table cloth and Windows etc. You can use your own Inn environment by using these props.
Models are made with more than 6 textures. The 3D Stylized Medieval inn Pack consists of different objects created individually, so you can use them to create an intuitive and eye-catching 
user interface for your 3D game or animated video. The vectors can be edited and placed at any scene in the game/video to give it a more defined look.
